# Cryptographer - Cryptocurrency Price Tracking Project

As someone who enjoys backend programming much more than frontend design, this was my favorite part of my project. I spent a lot of time trying to make this
beautiful but think it could still use many improvements. You can find the deployed full stack app at - https://cryptographer1.netlify.app/
Feel free to reach out to me @ iansilber32@gmail.com with any errors/suggestions you may run into!

Things to cover:

* Ruby version - 3.0.1

* Rails version - 6.1.4.1

* Database - postgreSQL

* Database initialization - you will want to run a db:seed to create the top 15 coins
